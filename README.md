# User_Access_Control_Framework
Data security refers to the protection of data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. It involves implementing measures and safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Data security aims to prevent unauthorized individuals or entities from accessing sensitive or private information and ensures that data remains accurate and reliable.

Data security involves various practices, technologies, and policies designed to protect data throughout its lifecycle. This includes:

●	Authentication and Access Control
●	Encryption
●	Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
●	Firewall and Network Security
●	Secure Data Storage
●	Employee Education and Awareness
●	Security Policies and Compliance.

Data security is crucial for businesses and organizations to maintain the privacy of customer information, protect intellectual property, prevent financial losses, and maintain trust with stakeholders. It is an ongoing process that requires a combination of technology, policies, and user awareness to mitigate risks and safeguard sensitive data.

We're implementing data security measures at a granular level within a database system involving various approaches to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Row-Level Security (RLS)	Controlling access to individual rows based on predefined rules and attributes.
Column-Level Security (CLS)	Restricting access to specific columns or fields within a table.
Access Control and Privileges	Managing user permissions and roles at different levels.

By combining these approaches, organizations can implement robust and granular data security measures that align with specific security requirements and regulatory compliance obligations. It is important to assess the sensitivity of data, understand access requirements, and apply appropriate security controls to ensure data protection throughout its lifecycle.
